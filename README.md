# [Flipsearch](https://flipsearch.herokuapp.com/main)

A Click-to-Search demo for a House re-sale statistics application, primarily for the Bay-Area.

## Team

Aaron, Greg, and Jessie

## Description

This application demo was created as the second project for the UC Berkeley Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.

The purpose of the application was to set up an application with some data that could help determine what places in the Bay-Area could present opportunities for re-selling houses.

We decided to set up the application with a click-to-search feature, instead of a traditional search bar, as it seemed more intiutive to allow the user to select the area on the map.

The data was collected from a variety of sources whose quality may vary, and is mostly there to demonstrate the click-to-search feature.
